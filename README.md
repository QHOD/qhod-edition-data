# qhod-edition-data

Repository for published TEI data from the QhoD project (<https://qhod.net>).

TEI data is organized by sub-projects within the QhoD framework: 

- **vipa**: Project 1: The Grand Embassies of Damian Hugo von Virmont and Ibrahim Pasha (1719/20)
- **sema**: Project 3: The Letters of Selim II to Maximilian II and Mustafa Paşa (1566–1574)
- **qhod**: generic data such as the tei:standOff data

All edition text data is licenced under CC-BY 4.0, image data is published with permission from the holding institutions (documented in the tei:sourceDesc of each document). 

As Git LFS support for the combination of GitHub and Zenodo is somehow broken, consult the published edition data directly at <https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7648909>.
